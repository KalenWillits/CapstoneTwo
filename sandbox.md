Our prediction is giving okay metrics of nearly 75% accuracy. Still, this does not satisfy our accuracy requirements. Even worse is we can assume this model is over-fit to our data and will make even worse predictions moving forward as the seasons change and flights are affected differently from weather. This was an interesting experiment, however we need to get regression to work.

Next I will try an SVR model. I think this makes sense because it will be better suited for all the outliers we are currently struggling to work with.
